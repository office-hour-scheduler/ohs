Our back end is using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) over the built in unittest module as the test runner. Unittest is greatly influenced by JUnit, and overall not very pythonic. Pytest is function and fixture based, and only require bare asserts to produce quality test reports.

We have mostly unit tests in our back end. Unit tests helps us identify problems early, and hit more corner cases overall than integration tests. Unit tests also makes TTD easier, since we will only need to focus on one part of the code base. We are using the [pytest-cov](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov) plugin to report test coverage, and we are running our tests on [Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/office-hour-scheduler/ohs) for every commit, and uploading coverage reports to [codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/office-hour-scheduler/ohs)
