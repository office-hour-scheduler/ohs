# Scope

Our main learning goals for this project will be to become familiar with GraphQL, since it’s a new and powerful way to design an API. All of us are already familiar with REST, so a new technology like this would be beneficial to learn. Most of us are also hoping that these skills will become useful towards future job searches.

GraphQL is an API query language, so the public interface of the backend will be handled for us. We can focus on implementation of business logic and UI. From this, we can select use-cases with emphasis on backend behaviour rather than worrying about how the endpoints are exposed. GraphQL also allows us to set up more calls to the backend since it is flexible on what kind of requests it accepts.
 
We will begin by implementing the following features as they are core functionality of the app:
- Create/Delete lecture sections (Section)
- Associate Office hours to each section
- Split each section of office hours into Slots
- Booking a slot for a meeting/Editing a booking
- Attaching notes/comments/urls to a meeting
 
Some use cases can even be filling simply by creating views for the information. We will also fulfill as many of these as we can. This will allow some team members to focus on honing their front-end skills with React rather than always focusing on backend.
 
After this is all done, we can focus on some of the “extra” features:
- Set notifications
- Calender integration
- Reminders when a meeting is coming up/almost done
- “Sorry I’m Late” notification
 
Overall, our design will stay as close as possible to the use-cases outlined on the midterm, and our features will focus on fulfilling them.
